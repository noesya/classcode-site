<p>Women in AI (WAI) is a nonprofit do-tank working towards inclusive AI that benefits global society. We are a community-driven initiative bringing empowerment, knowledge and active collaboration via education, research, events, and blogging. At Women in AI we empower women and minorities to become AI &amp; Data experts, innovators and leaders. We encourage ethical applications and responsible use of artificial intelligence. WAI was founded in 2016 in Paris, France, by Dr. Hanan Salam, Caroline Lair and Moojan Asghari. What initially started with a small Facebook group has grown into a powerful community with more than 8.000 members (and counting) in 140 countries.</p>
